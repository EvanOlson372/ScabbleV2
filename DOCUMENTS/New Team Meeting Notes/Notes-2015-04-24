Evan Leo and Savannah

Savannah spent the first half hour trying to get Eclipse working.  Then moved to writing tests and taking notes.

Evan has been working on resolving errors in the code revolving around word placement.  He got the functionality 
completed that checks to see if a letter played is part of more than one word.  It checks for letters on all sides,
not just the letters in the same row or column. 

We still need to change the code that scores the words.  As of right now the code counts a letter twice if it is part
of 2 different words.

Leo spent the time reading up about the RMI and is trying to get that working since it is a large portion of the grade.
