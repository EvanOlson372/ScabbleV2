Start 7 pm
Evan and Leonarod reworked UI because of cluter problems that were confusing us when trying to get things to work together 
this includes BoardButtonHAndler,RackButonHandler,ScrabbleUI
added several accesors and mutators in a lot of the data structure code to give us information that we needed to display and change as the game was played
we felt that we needed to completley restructure the program because of a lot of spaghetti coding that happened days prior becuase of time constraints. 
Ended 2am
