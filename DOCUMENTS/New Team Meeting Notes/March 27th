Friday March 27th - during lab

We discussed our reasons for why we chose Candidate code E.

- MINIMAL CODE - It was important for us to use a project that had minimal code.  Because the rules of the project prevent us from 
erasing the work of other groups, we felt that it would be important to find a project with just the skeleton of the project, this way 
we will not need to erase any of their code.  We worried that if we chose Candidate C for example that we would be forced in a 
direction that we did not like or that was inefficient.  For this reason we narrowed the options down to A & E.

- ANNOTATIONS - We wanted a project with a lot of annotations within the code.  It was important for us to know what we were looking at
so that we did not have to waste time trying to figure out how all of the code came together.

- GROUP MEETING NOTES - Another important part was how in depth the group meeting notes were.  Unfortunately, this is where Candidate E & A 
were both lacking a little bit.  Neither of them had great notes, but at the same time they wrote enough annotations in their code that we 
felt we did not need detailed notes to work off of. 

- SIMPLICITY - Ultimately it came down to which group had the cleanest and most simple code.  Candidate A used the brute force method when 
writing code. To be specific they had way too much code in order to fill the bad.
