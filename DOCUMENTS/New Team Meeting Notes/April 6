April 6 2pm

We worked for 2 hours, individually and then consulted each other as we came across problems and helped eachother brainstorm.  
Savannah worked on the GUI and got the buttons to be of the same size and put some research into how to customize JButtons.  
We are between having the JButton change color and letter after it is pressed, or using a tile image to sit over the JButton.

Leo worked on changing and setting the player color as well.

Kelly worked to create the scanner that looks through the dictionary and matches the word on the board to the word in the 
dictionary file.
