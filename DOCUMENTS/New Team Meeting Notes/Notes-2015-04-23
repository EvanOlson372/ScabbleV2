Thursday April 23rd 7pm

Evan and Savannah met in Hoch to cover the topics of tile placement and word verification.

During the 2 hours we met, Evan finished off the feature that Kelly and Leo started (random colors assigned to 
each player).  Then the focus moved to how to verify that a word is a word.  The problem was that the dictionary
scanner only knew the letters that were played, and the order that they were played in.  We solved a few problems 
(and by we I mean Evan)  

Vertical vs Horizontal - The coordinates of every tile played in a turn is added to an array, one labeled _col to represent
the column and one labeled _row to represent the row of the tile.  If all of the values in the _row Array are the same then
we know that the word is horizontal and that we should read it right to left.  If the values in the _col Array are the same 
then we know that the word is vertical and that we should read it from top to bottom.

Letter order - From the 2 arrays created above, which ever direction the word is going we then check to see if there are 
any tiles in the coordinate one value lower. Then the scanner reads all tiles connected regardless of who played it.

Letter placement - After the first play the game forces you to place every single tile next to another tile by checking for
tiles in the coordinates on all 4 sides.  (If we have time at the end of the game we will change this so that it doesn't 
check until the end of the turn, however, this is the easiest code to create right now)

Goals for next time:

Leo & Kelly create the RMI before moving forward with anything else or finishing off the steps from Stage 2
