Team meeting 5/4 2:00pm

Kelly, Leo, Savannah

We matched up classes from our game with the classes from the example RMI.  

To Do List:
-restore functionality
-High Score Capability
-Othello Scoring Functioning properly
-15% (60) squares have a 2 letter multiplier -10% (40) squares have a 3 letter multiplier - all others have 
	a multiplier of 1
-10% (40) squares have a 2 word multiplier -5% (20) squares have a 3 word multiplier - all others have a 
	one word multiplier
-once multipliers have been used they revert to 1 but are used for all words placed over it
-TESTSSSS
-update design document
-code documentation
-technical guide
-userguide

-Enforce Valid Word Placements... AT END OF TURN NOT DURING TURN
-finish RMI
-wrap around for words
-order of initial play random?
-ability to name players
-tile color rather than text color
-ability to recolor one or more tiles, if for example the word AM was on the board and someone turns it into
	LAMB by adding L & B then all letters count and should change color.
-are all touching words valid? not just the word placed?
-if tiles are not placed together to form one word with no spaces then the tiles must be returned to their rack.
-what happens if there are not enough tiles to refill the tile rack?
-game ends if all players pass in a row
-game ends if all tiles are gone in inventory and at least 1 players rack
-do we have a winning screen?
-go through and figure out what methods existed before us and what we changed.
