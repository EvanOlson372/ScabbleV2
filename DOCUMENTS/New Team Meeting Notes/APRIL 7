April 7 4:00
Evan and Leonardo did some paired programming 

PLAYER COLORS
Leonardo implemented a color option for players where you can set a color to each player with Evan as Navigator

BOARD
We had some errors that weren't allowing us to open up the Scrabble board 
We fixed it by creating a new ArrayList for players
With Evan as Driver and Leonardo as Navigator we are trying to figure out how to add multiple panels to a single JFrame so
so that you can have several player racks and the 20x20 board on the same window 
we tried changing the layout to Boarder or Box layouts to see if we both panels would pop up on the window 

Ended 6:00
