Wednesday April 1st.


GUI
We had some problems getting the Git to commit changes from Savannah's computer. We decided that we
are going to base our GUI off of the Tic Tac Toe GUI found under Student -> Working Directory -> 
WednesdayDemo.  This is a basic grid layout and will give us a great jumping off point.  However,
we have decided that it might be best to start the GUI sooner than later, however, not until after 
we have researched the best way to approach it.

DICTIONARY
We have added a basic dictionary containing only 3 words.  This will give us the ability to test our 
code but it will keep the tests small and manageable.  THe dictionary will have 1 word per line and 
the scanner will read the code line by line.  (Hopefully the dictionary that professor Alphonce gives 
us will have a similar layout.
